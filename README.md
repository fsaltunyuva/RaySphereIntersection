# Ray-Sphere Intersection

Testing the ray-sphere intersection formula by creating a virtual environment that consists of a sphere (located in <0, 0 -1>, camera (located in <0, 0, 0>), and rays (casting to each pixel in the image). 

In the code, if a ray intersects with the sphere it paints that pixel to red color and by doing so, the sphere's shape can be seen in the PPM image. 

Used formula can be seen in the image below. This image is taken from the video [Ray Tracing - Introduction to Computer Graphics course by Cem Yuksel.](https://youtu.be/gGKup9tUSrU?feature=shared&t=1227)
